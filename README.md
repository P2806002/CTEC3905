To complete the coursework for the CTEC3905 Front-end Web Development module, you need to follow these steps:

Project Requirements
Create a Website: Develop a website consisting of no more than 4 separate pages (or 4 distinct screen sections for a Single-Page Application) on a topic of your choice, such as a portfolio, business site, interests, or game reviews.
Learning Outcomes
Ensure your project demonstrates the following learning outcomes:

Use GIT and GitHub for version control and code storage.
Critical understanding of Information Architecture, user interface design, usability principles, and semantic markup.
Detailed understanding of front-end web technologies, their use, and context.
Creation of a fully standards-compliant, responsive, and accessible website or web-technology-based application.
Deliverables
GitHub Repository: A private GitHub classroom repository will be created for you within the CTEC3905 GitHub organization. Ensure your development process is captured with regular commits.
Submission: Submit a link to this repository via the learning zone.
Key Marking Criteria
The project will be evaluated under the following main headings, each worth 25% of the mark, with five criteria each:

HTML and CSS Code Quality:

Tidy file and folder organization with lower-case filenames.
Consistent code nesting and indentation.
Use CSS for layout, avoiding <table> or <br> tags.
Valid HTML5 and CSS3 source code.
Separate .css and .js files.
Responsiveness, Accessibility, and Interaction:

Use of modern CSS features (e.g., flex, grid, keyframes).
Web accessibility (semantic elements, alt attributes, heading structure).
Responsive design with mobile-first CSS breakpoints.
Well-ordered information architecture and ease of navigation.
Coherent overall design (color, content, styles).
GIT Version Control:

Source code on GitHub classroom.
Regular commits, not concentrated in the last few days.
Brief, informative commit messages.
Basic readme.md file with references in markdown format.
Use of GIT branches for feature development.
JavaScript, APIs, and JSON:

No JavaScript errors in the browser console.
Use modern syntax (e.g., let and const over var, template literals, arrow functions).
JavaScript for DOM manipulation and interaction.
DRY code principles (avoiding repeated similar functions).
More complex JavaScript to handle data or JSON from an external API.
